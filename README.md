# Ag_Camera
Place to store all the information I have found around agriculture cameras. And code I have written to use them in new ways.


### Case IH AFS700 & New Holland IntelliView IV Monitor
Both of these displays use a BNC connector on the bottom as analog camera input. 

This means that for a normal RV camera (usually a M12 4 Pin connector) can be connected an ran on the display will minimal effort using a Male BNC + M12 4 Pin Male converter. The converter will also need a power input to give the camera power as the BNC connector is just for video not power. The M12 4 Pin will then bring the power back to the camera.

Here is a image of the all the components that I used to put cameras on a CASE 6140 combine, CASE 235 Magnum, and New Holland T7.235

I connected the 12V Car Cigarette Ligher Socket Power Adapter to a 2.1mm x 5.5mm Female Connector Cable I had laying around.

Total Price: $29.35 per camera

Here is an image of the location on the display with a Male BNC connector pluged into the bottom of the display.
